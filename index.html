              Though the Karachi region has been inhabited for millennia, the
              city was founded as the fortified village of Kolachi in 1729. The
              settlement drastically increased in importance with the arrival of
              British East India Company in the mid 19th century. The British
              embarked on major works to transform the city into a major
              seaport, and connected it with their extensive railway network.By
              the time of the Partition of British India, the city was the
              largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000.
              Following the independence of Pakistan, the city's population
              increased dramatically with the arrival of hundreds of thousands
              of Muslim refugees from India. The city experienced rapid economic
              growth following independence, attracting migrants from throughout
              Pakistan and South Asia. According to the 2017 census, Karachi's
              total population was 16,051,521 and its urban population was 14.9
              million. Karachi is one of the world's fastest growing cities, and
              has communities representing almost every ethnic group in
              Pakistan. Karachi is home to more than two million Bangladeshi
              immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas
              from Myanmar.
